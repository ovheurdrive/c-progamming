Exercise 1
==========

A little handling of input/output and basics functions on int:


1) Write a program that take a number as input through the method you want, and output its square value (all inside main function).

2) Refactor the program : make a function "Power" that takes two int as input (a,b) and outputs a^b. 

3) (Advanced) put the power function in another file with a header file.
