Exercise 4
==========

Exercising with pointers (-:c

1) Write a program that take two numbers as input (a,b), send them to a function (ideally in another file) which returns nothing but perform the euclidian division of a by b and set a to the quotient and b to the remain.

2)Create a structure which contains (a,b,r,q), send a pointer to it to the function which perform the same calculus but sets q to the quotient and r to the remains, display the result in an understandable sentence with the 4 numbers.

3)Create a second function who use the first one to return the PGCD of two numbers using euclide algorithm (maybe complexify the structure).
