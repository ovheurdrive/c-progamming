Exercise 6
==========

Final Exercise : USe all you know about C

In this peculiar exercise, we're gonna do Object Oriented Programming in C.
The aim is to recreate the "String" class of C++ (maybe not with all methods).

In order to do it, you will create a type String on a structure.
The structure will contain function pointers (equivalent of methods here) and variables (attributes).
The class will be defined in another file, and yoou're gonna use the container types to make sure
the methods can't be used outside of the objects.
