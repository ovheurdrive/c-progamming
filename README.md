C progamming repository
=======================

Short programs to learn how c works :

* Standard Library and I/O.
* Basic syntax of the language : conditions, loops, types, operators, functions, etc...
* Pointers :  Basics / Memory Allocation.

The "Courses" are to be taken in a specific order : some in Basics need the understanding of the Basics of Pointers
The recommended order is the following

* Basics/TypesAndOperators
* Basics/ConditionsAndLoops
* Basics/Functions
* Basics/IO (First Part)
* Basics/HeadersAndMultipleSourceFiles
* PointersAndMemory/PointerBasics
* Basics/Preprocessor
* Basics/StringsAndArrays
* Basics/TypeCast
* Basics/IO (Second Part)
* PointersAndMemory/IntroductionToProcessVirtualMemory
* PointersAndMemory/MemAlloc
* PointersAndMemory/ChainedLists
* PointersAndMemory/FunctionsPointers (In Progress)

There are some exercises yoou can do to practice a specific part but i recommend to read all the courses before starting exercise 2.
* Exercise 1 : Basics I/O, Functions, Multiple files, etc...
* Exercise 2 : String handling
* Exercise 3 : Preprocessor 
* Exercise 4 : Playin' with pointers
* Exercise 5 : Memory Allocation
* (Bonus) Exercise 6 : Modular programming in C

Requirements : 
* A basic knowledge of the C language syntax
* GIT interface : Babun/Cygwin, git on Linux/Mac
* C/C++ IDE : CodeBlocks, Visual Studio, VIM/EMACS
* Debugger : OllyDBG , Immunity Debugger , GDB


All those source codes aren't perfect (they leak, variables names are shit) but it's in the purpose of learning assisted orally by someone who knows what he is talking about.
Every file is subject to further improvements/alterations, but remember that it isn't perfect at all.
If you're interested in contributing, you'll be welcomed cheerfully.
