C progamming repository
=======================

Short programs to learn how c works :

* Standard Library and I/O.
* Basic syntax of the language : conditions, loops, types, operators, functions, etc...
* Pointers :  Basics / Memory Allocation.

The "Courses" are to be taken in a specific order : some in Basics need the understanding of the Basics of Pointers
The recommended order is the following

* Basics/TypesAndOperators
* Basics/ConditionsAndLoops
* Basics/Functions
* Basics/IO (First Part)
* Basics/HeadersAndMultipleSourceFiles
* PointersAndMemory/PointerBasics
* Basics/Preprocessor
* Basics/StringsAndArrays
* Basics/TypeCast
* Basics/IO (Second Part)
* PointersAndMemory/IntroductionToProcessVirtualMemory
* PointersAndMemory/MemAlloc
* PointersAndMemory/ChainedLists
* PointersAndMemory/FunctionsPointers

There are some exercises you can do to practice a specific part.
* Exercise 1 : Basics I/O, Functions, Multiple files, etc...    ( Recommended : Read to PointerBasics )
* Exercise 2 : String handling                                  ( Recommended : Read To StringsAndArrays ) 
* Exercise 3 : Preprocessor                                     ( Recommended : Read to TypeCast )
* Exercise 4 : Playin' with pointers                            ( Recommended : Read to MemAlloc )
* Exercise 5 : Memory Allocation                                ( Recommended : Read all the Chapters )
* (Bonus) Exercise 6 : Modular programming in C                 ( Recommended : Successfully achieve all Exercises before this one )

Requirements : 
* A basic knowledge of the C language syntax
* GIT interface : Babun/Cygwin, git on Linux/Mac
* C/C++ IDE : CodeBlocks, Visual Studio, VIM/EMACS
* Debugger : OllyDBG , Immunity Debugger , GDB


All those source codes aren't perfect (they may leak, variables names are shit) but it's in the purpose of learning assisted orally by someone who knows what he is talking about.
Every file is subject to further improvements/alterations, but remember that it isn't perfect at all.
If you're interested in contributing, you'll be welcomed cheerfully.
